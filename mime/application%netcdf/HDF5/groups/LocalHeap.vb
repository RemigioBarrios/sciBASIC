	''' <summary>
	''' A local heap is a collection of small pieces of data that are particular to a single object in the HDF5 file.
	''' Objects can be inserted and removed from the heap at any time. The address of a heap does not change once the
	''' heap is created. For example, a group stores addresses of objects in symbol table nodes with the names of
	''' links stored in the groupâ€™s local heap.
